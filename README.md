## Features

Waterfall focuses on three main areas:

* **Stability**: Waterfall aims to be stable. We will achieve this through making the code base testable and discouraging practices that lead to proxy lag.
* **Features**: Waterfall aims to include more features than canonical BungeeCord.
* **Scalability**: Waterfall should be able to handle a large number of concurrent players, given a reasonably modern CPU, memory, and good network connection.

FlameCord being a fork of Waterfall, has all its features, and some of its own, such as:

* **Exploit Fixes**: FlameCord specializes in providing better server security by fixing major exploits, performance flaws and bugs that Bungeecord already has, and that have not yet been fixed in WaterfallMC.

## Why fork Waterfall?

Waterfall was forked out of a desire for greater protection to be afforded to a Bungeecord-based proxy, which Waterfall currently cannot offer.

FlameCord will track upstream Waterfall and merge changes as needed.
