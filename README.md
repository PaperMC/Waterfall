FlameCord is a Waterfall fork or modification that adds antibot features, exploit prevention systems, performance improvements, removal of unused features, library updates and application layer ddos mitigation.

## ⭐ Features

FlameCord being a fork of Waterfall, has all its features, and some of its own, such as:

* **Exploit Fixes**: FlameCord specializes in providing better server security by fixing major exploits, performance flaws and bugs that Bungeecord already has, and that have not yet been fixed in WaterfallMC.
  
* **Antibot Features**: FlameCord brings swift bot protection for your Minecraft server to avoid extra CPU usage and crashes in your machines.

* **Performance Improvements**: FlameCord tries to improve performance by removing unused features and disabling exception logs.

## 💻 Why fork Waterfall?

FlameCord was forked out of a desire for greater protection to be afforded to a Bungeecord-based proxy, which Waterfall currently cannot offer.

FlameCord will track upstream Waterfall and merge changes as needed.

## 🌱 Get Started

Just drag an drop FlameCord.jar into your server folder and run it.

You can customize many FlameCord features in the flamecord.yml file.
